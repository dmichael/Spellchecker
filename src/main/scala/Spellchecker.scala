/**
 * A simple class that can act as a spellchecker
 * - could be extended to autocomplete
 *
 * The basic principle here is that words forming the dictionary are stored in a tree structure,
 * with unique values [a-z] at each node. Children of each node are also unique in the set [a-z].
 * In this way, words are stored by traversing common keys down the branches until the final leaf
 * is found (or not as the case may be).
 *
 * Finding the word once the tree is constructed is essentially a breadth-first search through each layer
 * of the tree
 *
 * I believe this is called a trie
 * It should look something like this:
 *           s
 *          / \
 *         a   o
 *        /\    \
 *       v  f    f
 *      /    \    \
 *     e      e    a
 *
 *  TODO: Make all structures immutable. Specifically, change HashMap if possible.
